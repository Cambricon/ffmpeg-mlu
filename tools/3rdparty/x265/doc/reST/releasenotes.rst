Release Notes
*************

Version 2.8
===========

Release date - 21/05/2018

New features
-------------
1. :option:`--asm avx512` used to enable AVX-512 in x265. Default disabled.	
    For 4K main10 high-quality encoding, we are seeing good gains; for other resolutions and presets, we don't recommend using this setting for now.

2. :option:`--dynamic-refine` dynamically switches between different inter refine levels. Default disabled.
    It is recommended to use :option:`--refine-intra 4' with dynamic refinement for a better trade-off between encode efficiency and performance than using static refinement.

3. :option:`--single-sei`
    Encode SEI messages in a single NAL unit instead of multiple NAL units. Default disabled. 

4. :option:`--max-ausize-factor` controls the maximum AU size defined in HEVC specification.
    It represents the percentage of maximum AU size used. Default is 1. 
	  
5. VMAF (Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion)
   Added VMAF support for objective quality measurement of a video sequence. 
   Enable cmake option ENABLE_LIBVMAF to report per frame and aggregate VMAF score. The frame level VMAF score does not include temporal scores.
   This is supported only on linux for now.
 
Encoder enhancements
--------------------
1. Introduced refine-intra level 4 to improve quality. 
2. Support for HLG-graded content and pic_struct in SEI message.

Bug Fixes
---------
1. Fix 32 bit build error (using CMAKE GUI) in Linux.
2. Fix 32 bit build error for asm primitives.
3. Fix build error on mac OS.
4. Fix VBV Lookahead in analysis load to achieve target bitrate.


Version 2.7
===========

Release date - 21st Feb, 2018.

New features
------------
1. :option:`--gop-lookahead` can be used to extend the gop boundary(set by `--keyint`). The GOP will be extended, if a scene-cut frame is found within this many number of frames. 
2. Support for RADL pictures added in x265.
   :option:`--radl` can be used to decide number of RADL pictures preceding the IDR picture.

Encoder enhancements
--------------------
1. Moved from YASM to NASM assembler. Supports NASM assembler version 2.13 and greater.
2. Enable analysis save and load in a single run. Introduces two new cli options `--analysis-save <filename>` and `--analysis-load <filename>`.
3. Comply to HDR10+ LLC specification.
4. Reduced x265 build time by more than 50% by re-factoring ipfilter.asm.  

Bug fixes
---------

2. Fixed Mac OS build warnings.
3. Fixed inconsistency in pass-2 when weightp and cutree are enabled.
4. Fixed deadlock issue due to dropping of BREF frames, while forcing slice types through qp file.


Version 2.6
===========

Release date - 29th November, 2017.

New features
------------
1. x265 can now refine analysis from a previous HEVC encode (using options :option:`--refine-inter`, and :option:`--refine-intra`), or a previous AVC encode (using option :option:`--refine-mv-type`). The previous encode's information can be packaged using the *x265_analysis_data_t*  data field available in the *x265_picture* object.
2. Basic support for segmented (or chunked) encoding added with :option:`--vbv-end` that can specify the status of CPB at the end of a segment. String this together with :option:`--vbv-init` to encode a title as chunks while maintaining VBV compliance!
3. :option:`--force-flush` can be used to trigger a premature flush of the encoder. This option is beneficial when input is known to be bursty, and may be at a rate slower than the encoder.
4. Experimental feature :option:`--lowpass-dct` that uses truncated DCT for transformation.

Encoder enhancements
--------------------
1. Slice-parallel mode gets a significant boost in performance, particularly in low-latency mode.
2. x265 now officially supported on VS2017.
3. x265 now supports all depths from mono0 to mono16 for Y4M format.

API changes
-----------
1. Options that modified PPS dynamically (:option:`--opt-qp-pps` and :option:`--opt-ref-list-length-pps`) are now disabled by default to enable users to save bits by not sending headers. If these options are enabled, headers have to be repeated for every GOP.
2. Rate-control and analysis parameters can dynamically be reconfigured simultaneously via the *x265_encoder_reconfig* API.
3. New API functions to extract intermediate information such as slice-type, scenecut information, reference frames, etc. are now available. This information may be beneficial to integrating applications that are attempting to perform content-adaptive encoding. Refer to documentation on *x265_get_slicetype_poc_and_scenecut*, and *x265_get_ref_frame_list* for more details and suggested usage.
4. A new API to pass supplemental CTU information to x265 to influence analysis decisions has been added. Refer to documentation on *x265_encoder_ctu_info* for more details.

Bug fixes
---------
1. Bug fixes when :option:`--slices` is used with VBV settings.
2. Minor memory leak fixed for HDR10+ builds, and default x265 when pools option is specified.
3. HDR10+ bug fix to remove dependence on poc counter to select meta-data information.

Version 2.5
===========

Release date - 13th July, 2017.

Encoder enhancements
--------------------
1. Improved grain handling with :option:`--tune` grain option by throttling VBV operations to limit QP jumps.
2. Frame threads are now decided based on number of threads specified in the :option:`--pools`, as opposed to the number of hardware threads available. The mapping was also adjusted to improve quality of the encodes with minimal impact to performance.
3. CSV logging feature (enabled by :option:`--csv`) is now part of the library; it was previously part of the x265 application. Applications that integrate libx265 can now extract frame level statistics for their encodes by exercising this option in the library.
4.  Globals that track min and max CU sizes, number of slices, and other parameters have now been moved into instance-specific variables. Consequently, applications that invoke multiple instances of x265 library are no longer restricted to use the same settings for these parameter options across the multiple instances.
5. x265 can now generate a seprate library that exports the HDR10+ parsing API. Other libraries that wish to use this API may do so by linking against this library. Enable ENABLE_HDR10_PLUS in CMake options and build to generate this library.
6. SEA motion search receives a 10% performance boost from AVX2 optimization of its kernels.
7. The CSV log is now more elaborate with additional fields such as PU statistics, average-min-max luma and chroma values, etc. Refer to documentation of :option:`--csv` for details of all fields.
8. x86inc.asm cleaned-up for improved instruction handling.

API changes
-----------
1. New API x265_encoder_ctu_info() introduced to specify suggested partition sizes for various CTUs in a frame. To be used in conjunction with :option:`--ctu-info` to react to the specified partitions appropriately.
2. Rate-control statistics passed through the x265_picture object for an incoming frame are now used by the encoder.
3. Options to scale, reuse, and refine analysis for incoming analysis shared through the x265_analysis_data field in x265_picture for runs that use :option:`--analysis-reuse-mode` load; use options :option:`--scale`, :option:`--refine-mv`, :option:`--refine-inter`, and :option:`--refine-intra` to explore. 
4. VBV now has a deterministic mode. Use :option:`--const-vbv` to exercise.

Bug fixes
---------
1. Several fixes for HDR10+ parsing code including incompatibility with user-specific SEI, removal of warnings, linking issues in linux, etc.
2. SEI messages for HDR10 repeated every keyint when HDR options (:option:`--hdr-opt`, :option:`--master-display`) specified.

Version 2.4
===========

Release date - 22nd April, 2017.

Encoder enhancements
--------------------
1. HDR10+ supported. Dynamic metadata may be either supplied as a bitstream via the userSEI field of x265_picture, or as a json jile that can be parsed by x265 and inserted into the bitstream; use :option:`--dhdr10-info` to specify json file name, and :option:`--dhdr10-opt` to enable optimization of inserting tone-map information only at IDR frames, or when the tone map information changes.
2. Lambda tables for 8, 10, and 12-bit encoding revised, resulting in significant enhancement to subjective  visual quality.
3. Enhanced HDR10 encoding with HDR-specific QP optimzations for chroma, and luma planes of WCG content enabled; use :option:`--hdr-opt` to activate.
4. Ability to accept analysis information from other previous encodes (that may or may not be x265), and selectively reuse and refine analysis for encoding subsequent passes enabled with the :option:`--refine-level` option. 
5. Slow and veryslow presets receive a 20% speed boost at iso-quality by enabling the :option:`--limit-tu` option.
6. The bitrate target for x265 can now be dynamically reconfigured via the reconfigure API.
7. Performance optimized SAO algorithm introduced via the :option:`--limit-sao` option; seeing 10% speed benefits at faster presets.

API changes
-----------
1. x265_reconfigure API now also accepts rate-control parameters for dynamic reconfiguration.
2. Several additions to data fields in x265_analysis to support :option:`--refine-level`: see x265.h for more details.

Bug fixes
---------
1. Avoid negative offsets in x265 lambda2 table with SAO enabled.
2. Fix mingw32 build error.
3. Seek now enabled for pipe input, in addition to file-based input

Version 2.3
===========

Release date - 15th February, 2017.

Encoder enhancements
--------------------
1. New SSIM-based RD-cost computation for improved visual quality, and efficiency; use :option:`--ssim-rd` to exercise.
2. Multi-pass encoding can now share analysis information from prior passes (in addition to rate-control information) to improve performance and quality of subsequent passes; to your multi-pass command-lines that use the :option:`--pass` option, add :option:`--multi-pass-opt-distortion` to share distortion information, and :option:`--multi-pass-opt-analysis` to share other analysis information.
3. A dedicated thread pool for lookahead can now be specified with :option:`--lookahead-threads`.
4. option:`--dynamic-rd` dynamically increase analysis in areas where the bitrate is being capped by VBV; works for both CRF and ABR encodes with VBV settings.
5. The number of bits used to signal the delta-QP can be optimized with the :option:`--opt-cu-delta-qp` option; found to be useful in some scenarios for lower bitrate targets.
6. Experimental feature option:`--aq-motion` adds new QP offsets based on relative motion of a block with respect to the movement of the frame.

API changes
-----------
1. Reconfigure API now supports signalling new scaling lists.
2. x265 application's csv functionality now reports time (in milliseconds) taken to encode each frame.
3. :option:`--strict-cbr` enables stricter bitrate adherence by adding filler bits when achieved bitrate is lower than the target; earlier, it was only reacting when the achieved rate was higher.
4. :option:`--hdr` can be used to ensure that max-cll and max-fall values are always signaled (even if 0,0).

Bug fixes
---------
1. Fixed incorrect HW thread counting on MacOS platform.
2. Fixed scaling lists support for 4:4:4 videos.
3. Inconsistent output fix for :option:`--opt-qp-pss` by removing last slice's QP from cost calculation.
